Hello, I'm Sebastian, a passionate Data Scientist and Researcher with a unique background in both data science and biology. I hold a Master's degree in Data Science and a Bachelor's degree in Biology from Salzburg University, which has allowed me to blend my love for data with a deep understanding of the natural world.

# My Journey

I started my academic career in Technical Informatics at the Federal Higher Technical Institute (HTL) Salzburg, before diving deeper into the world of biology and data science. This interdisciplinary background allows me to approach problems from both a technical and biological perspective. Currently, I’m working as a Researcher at Salzburg Research Forschungsgesellschaft, where I specialize in prototype development and data analysis particularly in the fields of wearable sensors and motion tracking.

# What I Do

In my role, I handle everything from study design to data acquisition, digital signal processing and statistical evaluation. I'm passionate about using data to uncover insights that can drive innovation and research in areas such as human movement and sensor technology to improve health, performance and wellbeing.

# Beyond Data

When I’m not immersed in data or research, I enjoy pursuing a range of hobbies that keep me grounded and inspired. I’m an avid sports enthusiast, a lover of literature, and I have a deep appreciation for gardening and photography. My interests in neurobiology, botany, and behavioral biology continue to fuel my curiosity and passion for discovery.

# Publications & Talks

I’m committed to contributing to the scientific community, and you can find a selection of my publications and talks on this website. Feel free to browse through my research work for more details.
