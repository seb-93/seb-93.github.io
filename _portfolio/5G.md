As part of the project [5G Exploration Space](https://www.salzburgresearch.at/projekt/5g-exps/), a real-time feedback system was developed, and the suitability of 5G for sports applications was evaluated. The athletes' movements are captured using sensors, with intelligent integration and processing of various sensor data, followed by transmitting the results as real-time feedback to the athletes.
