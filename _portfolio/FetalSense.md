An automated, continuous monitoring system for the heart activity of unborn calves enhances birth monitoring and supports veterinarians in making informed decisions during calving. This technology aims to reduce birth complications and lower the stillbirth rate. As part of the [Fetal Sense](https://www.salzburgresearch.at/projekt/fetalsens/) project, ea prototype was dveloped to detect fetal ECG, paving the way for improved animal health and farm management.
