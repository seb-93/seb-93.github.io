[Digital Motion - NEXT](https://www.digital-motion.at/) focuses on making behavioral changes easier and improving the experience of physical activity, sports performance, and general well-being. This is achieved through a combination of behavioral psychology, movement data analysis, sustainable materials, and sensor technology.

By integrating insights from these fields, the goal is to help individuals better understand their physical activity patterns, adopt healthier habits, and optimize their performance and well-being in a sustainable manner.
