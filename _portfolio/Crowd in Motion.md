As part of the project [Crowd in Motion](https://www.salzburgresearch.at/projekt/edih-crowd-in-motion/) a digital guidance concept for DomQuartier Salzburg was developed, aiming to enhance the visitor experience through the use of sensor technology, real-time data, and artificial intelligence.

DomQuartier Salzburg, a museum complex surrounding Salzburg Cathedral Square, is being expanded and will include a new visitor center. The tour showcases the extensive collection of this unique UNESCO World Heritage site, as well as the historically and architecturally significant rooms.

To evenly distribute visitors throughout the exhibition spaces based on time and interests, and to enhance the experience of individual exhibits, new information services will be created using sensor data and AI-based systems. The goal is to develop a visitor guidance concept that uses objective real-time data on visitor distribution to recommend personalized tours based on individual interests while avoiding congestion. This will rely on data regarding visitor orientation, distribution, and density.
