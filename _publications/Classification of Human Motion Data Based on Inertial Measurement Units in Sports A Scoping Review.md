excerpt: 'Inertial measurement units (IMU) are widely used in sports applications to digitise human motion by measuring acceleration and rotational velocity in three-dimensional space. A common machine learning problem is the classification of human motion primitives from IMU data. In order to investigate the classification methods used in the existing literature and to analyse whether and how the time-dependent data structure is considered in the classification process of motion data analysis in sports, a scoping review was conducted. Based on a keyword search, articles from 2010 to 2021 were extracted, and 93 articles were relevant for data extraction. Over- and undersampling of data and data augmentation techniques were rarely used. The classification methods applied can be divided into three main branches: classic machine learning and deep learning models, threshold-based approaches, and dynamic time warping. The most often applied algorithms were support vector machines (SVM), followed by neural networks and k-nearest neighbours. In comparative works, when more than one classifier was applied, random forests, neural networks, boosting models and SVM were found to be the methods that achieved the highest accuracy. If the time-dependent data structure was taken into account, it was incorporated either within the models, for example, by using long-short-term memory models or within the feature calculation step by using rolling windows with an overlap, which was the most common method of considering the time dependency of the IMU data.'
