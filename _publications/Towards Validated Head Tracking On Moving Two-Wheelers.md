excerpt: 'We investigate the problem of validating head tracking methods while riding two-wheelers. A low-cost inertial measurement unit and an image-based system using fiducial markers are compared against a wearable motion capture system. Results show that both systems are capable of tracking head motion. However, signal drift correction and hardening against outdoor conditions are required to make the systems viable in real-life use.'
