excerpt: 'Sleep, or the lack thereof, has far-reaching consequences on many aspects of human physiology, cognitive performance, and emotional well-being. To ensure undisturbed sleep monitoring, unobtrusive measurements such as ballistocardiography (BCG) are essential for sustained, realworld data acquisition. Current analysis of BCG data during sleep remains challenging, mainly due to low signal-to-noise ratio, physical movements, as well as high inter-and intra-individual variability. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes a novel approach to improve J-peak extraction from BCG measurements using a supervised deep learning setup.The proposed method consists of the modeling of the discrete reference heartbeat events with a symmetric and continuous kernel-function, referred to as surrogate signal. Deep learning models approximate this surrogate signal from which the target heartbeats are detected. The proposed method with various surrogate signals is compared and evaluated with state-of-the-art methods from both signal processing and machine learning approaches. The BCG dataset was collected over 17 nights using inertial measurement units (IMUs) embedded in a mattress, together with an ECG for reference heartbeats, for a total of 134 hours. Moreover, we apply for the first time an evaluation metric specialized for the comparison of event-based time series to assess the quality of heartbeat detection.The results show that the proposed approach demonstrates superior accuracy in heartbeat estimation compared to existing approaches, with an MAE (mean absolute error) of 1.1 s in 64-second windows and 1.38 s in 8-second windows. Furthermore, it is shown that our novel approach outperforms current methods in detecting the location of heartbeats across various evaluation metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to encode temporal events using kernels and the first systematic comparison of various event encodings for event detection using a regression-based sequence-to-sequence model.
